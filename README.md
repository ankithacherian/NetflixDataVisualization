# Lab4 Netflix dashboard
The purpose of the coursework is to build a customized dashboard based on Netflix data. 

I have chosen to develop a dashboard to show an analysis of Netflix data using various charts and datasets.  Four different datasets [3 csv files and 1 json file) were required to build the dashboard as expected.
I have used D3 analytical and manipulation functions wherever necessary and has added animations.  
Word cloud was added to be more attractive.
Netflix dashboard was helpful in finding popular categories to find areas of improvement and top performing categories.
